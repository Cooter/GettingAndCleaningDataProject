## Getting and Cleaning Data: Project

### Code
This script contains the R script
run_analysis.R
If this script is run in a working directory containing the "UCI Har Dataset",
it will produce a tidy data set called
"UCIHarAvgBySubjectActivity.csv"
containing data that are averages for each subject and each activity
for all the variables that are means and standard deviations in the 
"UCI Har Dataset".
For more information see the CodeBook.md file.
